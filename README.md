# Raycaster engine

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/balintkiss501/raycaster-engine/master/demo.gif)

My take on making a raycasting pseudo-3D engine in C++, also with my own tiny template linear algebra lib. My goal is to make raycasting computation equations more explicit and readable.

## How to build and run

1. Get a C++11-standard compatible C++ compiler (g++ or clang)
2. Get and set up [SDL2 library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) (apt-get install libsdl2-dev)
3. Execute "make" command
4. Run your executable
